alias: Living Room Lights On
description: >-
  Turn living room lights on.

  Turn on the lights on the living room based on a couple of factors. Mainly
  the outside luminosity matters. This turns on lights when there is not
  enough light outside.

  Also, the entrance door to our living room has a sensor. If entering the room
  in the night, the lights will turn on.
