# Input boolean: Hall Variable Curtains Manual Override
#
# This is a variable. I use variables internally in automations and are not
# meant to be used from the frontend.
#
# This variable indicates if the hall curtains have been been manually overriden
# by an user. If so, it will stop interfering with the curtains automatically.
