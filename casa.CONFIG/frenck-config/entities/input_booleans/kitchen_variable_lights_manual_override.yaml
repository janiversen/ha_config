# Input boolean: Kitchen Variable Lights Manual Override
#
# This is a variable. I use variables internally in automations and are not
# meant to be used from the frontend.
#
# This variable indicates if the kitchen lights are manually overriden by
# an user. If so, it will stop interfering with the lights automatically.
